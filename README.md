# RPS-multiplayer
A multiplayer rock, paper, scissors game using firebase

****Warning*****
This game does not function properly all of the time. The 'unique username alerts' trigger impropeyly for anyone after the first person to join. If a player leaves, the game does not automatically refill thier spot. Instead, push reset and everyone will need to input a new username. This does not always work properly. The chat box also writres multiple lines upon submission.

However... if you load with an empty database (it will be set to empty when you first load), you should be able to add players, and complete rounds of the game without issue as long as player one and player two do not leave the game. Everyone after the first person may receive erroneous alerts about username uniqueness. 


Purpose: Practice using firebase and online databases with real time data updates

Instructions: enter your username. If you are player 1 or player 2, choose rock, paper, or scissors and wait for the other player to choose. Screens after username will not appear until 2 players have joined.

Getting Started: Load index.html
